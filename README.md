# Visma.Bootcamp.Hackathon v2.0

## It's time for you to SHINE ðŸŽ‰!

Hi! You've made it! Here we are, at the end of the 1st month of Bootcamp and there is one last challenge waiting for you. **Hackathon**! 

## The Quest

So your ultimate quest will be: create **ToDo App**. You know TODOs? Here's the example what can it look like:
![ToDoApp](https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/fea1fd80-a3e8-11e9-adad-75a98c588768-ezgif-3-31af7f249fae.gif)

We want you to create the **solution** for ToDo app:
```
- backend
  - choose any technology to create backend for your ToDo app - ASP.NET Core, Sprint Boot, ...
  - choose any storage for your data - SQL (MySQL, Postgres, ...), NoSQL (Firebase, Mongo, Redis, ...)
- frontend
  - choose any technology to create frontend for your ToDo app - Angular, ReactJS, VueJS, Static website, ...
  - make sure to not over-complicate your solution from the beginning
- mobile app
  - iOS app
  - make sure to not over-complicate your solution from the beginning
- will be hosted on any public cloud (use free credits)
  - Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, IBM, ...
- will be in Github repository
```

## Team Setup

This hackathon is about team work. Your team is now facing a great challenge and we need every one of you to join and help. 
**Make sure you select your project lead/scrum master, who will help to make decisions and lead the team.**

### Acceptance criteria

These are the minimal acceptance criteria we would like to see in your solutions:

#### For applications:
```
1. create ToDo item
2. update ToDo item
3. delete ToDo item
4. mark ToDos as complete / incomplete
```

#### For infrastructure
```
1. terraform infrastructure
2. will have at least 1 pipeline (CI or CD or both :))
```
---
Here's also the list of functionalities that you can get as an inspiration for your solutions, but they're not required to be implemented:

```
1. setting Due Date for ToDo item and showing warning once item is due
2. creating lists of different ToDos (Shopping, My Daily ToDoList, ...)
3. updating ToDo items as a bulk operation (setting Due Date for multiple items at once, ...)
4. login to the application so every user will have its own data
5. automatic deletion of items which are older than couple of weeks/months - periodic deletion
6. use your creativity and imagination :) 
```

## Rules

However, there are 2 rules, which all of you must obey:
```
1. You work as a team - make sure that every opinion counts 
2. You can ask **only** technical questions any of your Visma colleagues
```

## Recommendations from Tomas

I put down some recommendations for you that might help you building this solution:
```
1. Start with analysing your requirements
   - create list of epics at first and then write user stories so you can see what exactly you're going to build - or simply just create list of tasks
   - be agile, plan iterations and then start coding
   - use free tools like Trello as a kanban/scrum board to track your progress
2. Before you start coding, make sure you have every tool installed/decided 
   - make sure you have Azure / AWS account
   - make sure you have Git repository created
   - make sure you have all IDEs installed with all frameworks required
3. Track your progress and always test your functionality once you're done implementing a feature
4. Always ask for help, do not wait too long 
5. be creative - start small & expand later
```
